Deep Learning with Keras
==============

Its a copy my deep learning workshop/demostration for class CSE571 Spring 16 at ASU.

*The code is mostly modified from some of the mnist examples from keras/example*

**Addons**
- How to juggle between theano/tenserflow backends
- How to leverage on different visualization and debugging techniques
- How to hook-in different deep learning techniques
- How to go from simple to complex models

**Dependencies**
- theano
- tenserflow
- keras
- opencv (python)
- pyparsing (1.5.7)
- pydot (1.0.28)
- Others: matplotlib, ipython, ipynb reader
